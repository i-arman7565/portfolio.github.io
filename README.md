## Introduction

LinkedIn is a professional networking platform designed to connect professionals worldwide, facilitating career development, networking opportunities, and knowledge exchange. It serves as a digital hub where individuals and businesses showcase their professional profiles, share industry insights, and collaborate on projects. LinkedIn relies on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to improve search results, recommend relevant connections and content, manage user interactions, ensure data security, and enhance overall platform performance. They play a crucial role in optimizing user experiences and facilitating effective professional networking and career development on the platform.

- **Higher Engagement:** Increased user satisfaction and platform retention rates.

### Algorithms

### a. Queue
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Use Case:** Message storage and retrieval.

### b. HashMap
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for session tracking.
- **Use Case:** Track user sessions and their message queues.

### Approach

1. **Message Storage and Retrieval:** Use a queue for efficient message storage and retrieval.
2. **Session Tracking:** Implement a HashMap to manage user sessions and their respective message queues.
3. **Distributed Messaging Architecture:** Design a scalable architecture to handle high message volumes.

### Design

- **Queue:** Manages message storage and ensures ordered retrieval.
- **HashMap:** Tracks user sessions and queues, providing constant-time access.
- **Distributed Architecture:** Ensures scalability and low latency in message delivery.

### Implementation

The implementation involves setting up a distributed messaging architecture using queues for message handling and HashMaps for session management. This combination ensures efficient, real-time message delivery and scalability.
